      DOTA is a game where two teams, composed of five players each, make hundreds to thousands of decisions over 30 mins to an hour of hectic, simulating, and heart-wrenching gameplay. DOTA in its entirety can be over thousands of hours of gameplay with each game or hour being completely unique, an ever evolving set of rules(heroes , map layout , items , meta etc.), and a very vague way of keeping track of progress (MMR, play-style graph , hero performance etc.). Notably, DOTA has a player base of 10-12 million players resulting in each game you being paired with 9 other strangers (solo que) who you will probably not encounter again. As a result, the players (not the community) are very unforgiving of each other, have very little investment in others performance, and only care about the end(victory) and not the journey. Importantly, lets examine the nature of DOTA to gain a complete picture of what makes Improving at dota so hard and challenging.

      To put things into perspective imagine learning a new language, which is very modular with a base set of rules (alphabets, grammar, pronunciation etc.) and a very rigid structure in order to improve (just start memorizing and talking). Also important to note, that your daily practice can be entirely self-reliant and your progress will not be harshly judged by others, unless your into that sort of thing (aka why do I keep playing dota?). In addition, the progress in learning a new language is very noticeable(tangible) as your progress from forming words to sentences to entire conversations. <br>

      In my opinion, the biggest hindrance for dota players is their lack of self-examination. While the fact that DOTA is a team game cannot be ignored, simultaneously it is also a place where individual skills can reign supreme. Therein lies the problem, as players can become accustomed to thinking they make no mistakes and other players are to blame for losing the game (this was a bit of a tangent and I just needed to rant a bit). Most dota players never actively think about what is hindering their progress, or what they can do to progress faster, or even simply what is progress. This due to the tools, or more aptly the lack thereof, available to players to examine the aforementioned questions. Sure, you can re-watch your game and examine what you did wrong and have an epiphany of what you should be doing. But there are 2 major issues with that approach: did you accurately assess the game and are you actually incorporating your newfound knowledge (aka catch 22).

      Gaining comprehensive knowledge of DOTA is hard because DOTA is an insanely complex game with ~ 110 heros that each have 4 abilities, over 200 items that can enhance your heroes, several roles (carry , support , mid , offlane) that each have their own responsibility, and so much more that impact the overall gameplay. While many glaring problems can be easily noticed and fixed, there can be several to hundreds of other problems that are never accounted for. This isn&#39t because you are purposely ignoring these issues, although sometimes you might because of your own arrogance/ignorance (Lord knows I&#39m guilty of this).The real problem is that that you might not even be aware of the problem or know the solution.

      The easiest way to resolve this issue is to have a high skilled player coach you, but this is not practical nor feasible as most players do not have access to high skilled players. Alternatively, you can read guides, watch otherâ€™s gameplay, or even make a forum post asking others for help. Notably, these steps are not as helpful as straight-forward or effective as someone directly telling you what to do, as your have to intuitively figure out which of the newfound knowledge is most applicable to you. However, it is undoubtedly better than repeating the same mistakes and expecting a different outcome (ROAD TO 5K MMR).
